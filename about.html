                    <p id="tagline">Hey there! I am senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science
                        at Drexel University. This is a little (or a lot) about me.

                        <br><br>Throughout my academic career, I have had
                        the opportunity to work in industry twice. My first software development internship lasted 6
                        months and I
                        worked at a leading trading firm. My office was in the outskirts of Philadelphia.
                        Being on the electronic options trading team,
                        I had to reach my desk at 7 AM; 2 hours before 'market open' to ensure all financial systems
                        related to my team were up and running. I often stayed at work beyond 5 PM. The hours were long.
                        The work was interesting. I learned a lot. I developed an affinity for capital markets and writing code to crunch reference data was way more interesting in practice than it sounds. 

                        <br><br> My second foray into software development came roughly a
                        year later, when I worked at a 'FAANG' company out of Boston. I got to work with robots, more
                        specifically robotic arms. It was realy cool! I read a bunch of research papers. It remains the
                        first and only time
                        I worked in a professional capacity outside Philadelphia. My commute in Boston was hellish. I
                        walked a lot. Word to the wise, Boston gets cold. I was responsible for building the software architecture for a project that was supposed to be presented at an international robotics conference in Korea shortly after my internship would end.

                        <br><br> Right now, as a Full Stack Developer at the Ignyte Group, 
                        I'm leading the development of a responsive, mobile-first web application for a grants portfolio management system. 
                        My work here involves writing optimized, reusable code using modern web applications to build dynamic user interfaces and robust backend applications 
                        that adhere to best practices in scalability and cross-browser compatibility.
                        
                        <br><br> When I'm feeling lazy, I try to read Kent
                        Beck's Test Driven Development. I often think of the trolley problem. Being in the honors college, I got to take a bunch of non-traditional
                        courses - from philosophy to gene-editing. I end up liking these classes the most.
                        I argue with friends passionately about theology and religion. I don't shy away from controversial topics. In fact, I often gravitate towards them.
                        There is something beautiful about friends sitting around, disagreeing. I also spend an unhealthy amount of time watching soccer. I
                        say unhealthy, not because of the duration of watch time but rather because my team hasn't won a
                        major competition in over 8 years - sometimes, I question why I watch soccer in the first place.
                        <br><br> Over the pandemic I got pretty good at chess and often bully my friends by beating them
                        at
                        the game. My parents often ask me what I'd like to do long term and I often don't know the
                        answer. I initially started off trying to be an astronaught, then a soccer player, then a doctor
                        and finally setted on a software developer. I hope my mind doesn't decide to change my life
                        goals again - I'll save that for the eventual mid-life crises when I'm 40. Well, that was me in
                        a nutshell - and honestly, reading it back, it might be one of the worst elevator pitches in
                        history. But I promise you, I'm more interesting in person.

                <p>
                    Here's a brief description of the projects I've worked on:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><u>Automated Text Classification</u></strong> - <i>Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Plotly</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Worked under Dr. Weimao Ke to implement a novel algorithm (based on TF*IDF), reducing categorization errors by 18%.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Applied k-NNs and SVMs to train and test models on 10k randomly selected articles from the NY times annotated collection.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><u>LearnAI</u></strong> - <i>Docker, React.js, Flask, Postman</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Developed a containerized application for the Drexel College of Nursing with a grant of $15k to reduce academic dishonesty.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The app lets college faculty define learning material and fine-tune LLM models to guide students through learning activities.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Used OpenAI API endpoints in Langchain to interact with agents while maintaining conversation chains with buffer memory.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><u>OrderBook</u></strong> - <i>C++</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Designed a limit order book (buy & sell side) to simulate an exchange, balancing time complexity with market constraints.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Modular and reusable code implemented using design patterns to gain expertise into combining heaps with doubly linked lists.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><u>Speak Like Harry</u></strong> - <i>In Progress</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                In this project, I am trying to leverage NLP techniques to train my text generator model
                                on all of Harry Potter's lines from JK Rowling's texts.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The end goal is to autogenerate new lines which to a blind listener seem to be out of
                                Daniel Radcliffe's mouth himself.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><u>RubikAI</u></strong> - <i>Python</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The first AI class I took introduced me to various path finding algorithms and traversal
                                techniques. I didn't trust my professor
                                as to why one is better than the other. So I tested them all by trying to solve a
                                Rubik's cube.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The breadth first search uses a queue. A cube state is taken from the queue and all of
                                its possible children are added to the queue. This is repeated till a solution is found.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The IDS approach keeps implementing depth limiting search (0 onwards) till the depth
                                limit is reached or a solution is found.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A* uses a priority queue to implement the Manhattan distance heuristic - this gave me
                                the fastest results.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><u>Conway's Game of Life</u></strong> - <i>Javascript, HTML, CSS</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I became obsessed with an interview of John Conway that I saw on the Numberphile youtube
                                channel.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I built a visualization for Conway's Game of Life wherein you could initialize a 25X25
                                board with random starting configurations and let dead/alive cells fight it out.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><u>Survey Generator</u></strong> - <i>Java, JUnit, IntelliJ</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                End to end survey generation system that lets users create surveys, record responses, tabulate grades and serialize data.
                                Reusable object-oriented software implemented using design patterns.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Every line of source code was driven through unit test cases written in JUnit.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>
                                Applied the Sortino Ratio formula to calculate and compare the
                                profitability and risk of different investments using pandas.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Developed a fully functional SAT solver to implement Boolean satisfiability for up to 4 variable expressions in Racket (a functional programming language).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong><u>Data Parser</u></strong> - <i>Bash, AWK, Linux</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Bash script that generates XML files to display a subset of US Army
                                veteran data on formatted webpages.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Used AWK to scrape relevant data from a temporarily created CSV file
                                for every legitimate combination of input.
